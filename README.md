This mod is created to verify whether black market traders actually exists in the game, and is therefore very simple.
1. Tell a self-owned ship to "update trade offers" (aka "revisit known stations")
2. Ship will revisit stations
3. Ship will print to logbook: which stations in the sector have a black market trader
4. The player manually goes to said station(s) to unlock the traders

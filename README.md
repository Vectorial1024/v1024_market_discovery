This mod is created to verify whether black market traders actually exists in the game, and is therefore very simple.

After your scout finishes their Explore or Revisit Known Stations command, a logbook entry will be printed to tell you a random black market trader (unlocked or not) in the scouted sector.

This discovery process also rerolls black market traders in case there are absolutely none in the scouted sector. One theory is that EgoSoft overlooked their init scripts, and in effect, no black market traders will be spawned inside the vanilla space if any DLC is enabled. This theory matches reports about such traders being available only in DLC space.

## Known Issues

TER/PIO black market traders sometimes may not be unlocked because their stations do not have any comms signal leak. This is out of scope of this mod; please ask EgoSoft about this.
